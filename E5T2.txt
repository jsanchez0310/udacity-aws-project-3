# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
-Aquasec
### Example vulnerability
- Unauthorized Privilege Escalations
    IaC is used to provision full-stack cloud environments that may include Kubernetes, containers, and microservices. 
    Developers often use privileged accounts to provision cloud apps and other layers, 
    which introduces risk of privilege escalation. If this risk is combined with hard-coded secrets 
    and network exposures, a serious breach path is exposed to attackers.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
-Anchore Engine
### Example vulnerability
- Remote code execution
    Remote code execution, also known as RCE, is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to remotely 
    run arbitrary code on vulnerable servers and workstations. Attackers can then perform actions 
    to exploit other vulnerabilities. Remote code execution is the most common vulnerability 
    found in software today, and it can lead to other attacks, including denial-of-service 
    and elevation of privileges.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
-Alient Vault
### Example vulnerability
- Poor Access Management
    Improper access management is perhaps the most common cloud computing security risk. 
    In breaches involving web applications, stolen or lost credentials have been the most widely used tool 
    by attackers for several years.
